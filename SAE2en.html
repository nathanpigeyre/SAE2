                    <p>Arnold Lunn was an Englishman who found refuge in Switzerland, close to the mountains which for him was one of the most beautiful things in the world. Arnold Lunn is the inventor of modern skiing and the inventor of championships because he enjoyed organist ski races in Switzerland as a young man. Of course the Nordic people had been skiing for much longer but for them it was a necessity whereas for Arnold it was much more. He is considered to have invented, in 1922, the slalom and downhill, disciplines adopted by the International Ski Federation in the 1930s.</p>

                    <p> The first alpine skiing competition, a kind of rudimentary downhill race, took place in Oslo around 1850. A few decades later, skiing won over the rest of Europe and the United States of America, where miners organised ski competitions for winter entertainment. The first slalom was held in Mürren (Switzerland) in 1922, and two years later the race that would become the first Olympic Alpine skiing event was held.</p>

                    <p>Ski touring, the "goal" is to climb to the top of a snowy mountain with the necessary equipment, most often sealskins to avoid sliding backwards and skis with the heel off. So at the top you just have to remove the sealskin and put your bindings back on and you can go down to the bottom. Of course, for this practice you need to have already done some alpine skiing and with a relatively good level (knowing how to ski down the reds without problems and having already done some off-piste skiing). Indeed, the problem encountered in ski touring is the unpredictability of the snow : it can be frozen, crusty, powdery.</p>

                    <p>Alpine skiing is special in that you will need a lift to practice it in any case. Unlike ski touring, alpine skiing runs are marked and used much more often, which reduces the danger. Alpine skiing is practiced with poles, often with a helmet for more safety, glasses because the sun in the mountains with the reflection on the snow can attack your retina and of course shoes adapted and reinforced to avoid at most injuries. The risk of injury is still very high as skiing is possible at speeds of up to 90km/h, at which a collision can be fatal.</p>

                    <p>Cross-country skiing is also quite particular compared to ski touring and alpine skiing because it does not have the same skis, in fact, cross-country skis are very thin and very light which allows them to take more speed but they are also longer. The common point between alpine skis and cross-country skis is that the foot is attached to the ski. Cross-country skiing is practiced on fairly flat terrain and is most often practiced for championships.</p>

                    <p>Piau Engaly is the ski resort I grow up in, located in the centre of the Pyrenees, with 11 lifts and a record-breaking 2600m ski run. It is the highest ski run in the Pyrenees and has snow every year. Since I was 6 years old we have been going to this resort during the February holidays and skiing all day, I know every run as well as the bars. Piau Engaly is a very good ski resort opened since 1971, it is quite famous and quite big.</p>

                <p>Since I was little I have always loved skiing, being able to go very fast on the white slopes, having tingling thighs when skidding, races with my father and brother are very good memories. As far as my level of skiing is concerned I learned very quickly in 3 years I already had my gold star and I even participated in the arrow which is a tournament where I received the smallest award but it is still a victory.</p>
